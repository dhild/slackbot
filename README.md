# Drew Bot

The Drew Bot is a slack application, developed as an April Fool's joke targeting our favorite director.

## Features

### 2 Degrees of Separation

Unlike the usual [Six degrees of separation] which most people experience, Drew has the characteristic of being very
well-connected. In order to emulate Drew's expansive social network, drewbot watches conversations to see if anyone
mentions someone famous. When they do, drewbot sends a message mentioning that the ran into that person at a 
party/wedding/pub/etc.

### Bandersnatch

Drew is a sci-fi aficionado, and enjoyed the choose-your-own adventure movie [Bandersnatch] - in which the viewer is
able to interact with the film. In honor of this endeavour, the drewbot app contains slash commands to embark upon your
own adventure!
